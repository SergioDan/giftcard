App to share some loved to family ones

This project uses combine and tensorflow.
The tensorflow module is the style transfer sample project from google tensorflow repo [TensorFlow repo](https://github.com/tensorflow/examples)
Also I'm practicing combine, a toolkit developed by google to build apps faster, and I'm exploring ideas when organizing a project using this toolkit.

There are some "hardcoded" texts and assets for the initial iteration, but the idea is to make it customizable so it can be use in any occasion.
